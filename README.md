# Layered Architecture Samples
## A set of samples designed to demonstrate how to apply various .NET technologies using the Layered Architecture Pattern.

It is common for samples to feature or illustrate a specific .NET technology to facilitate the ease of learning but most developers were challenged when they need to put all of what they have learned into a complete functional enterprise application. This is what Layered Architecture Samples attempt to address.

##### NOTE: Samples for .NET 5 or .NET Core may be developed in future. 

### Leave Sample January 2014 (Upgraded to .NET 4.8) - Migrated from [Codeplex](https://layersample.codeplex.com)

The Leave Samples collection is designed to showcase various .NET Framework technologies such as Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF), Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), Windows Form, ASP.NET and ADO.NET Entity Framework working in conjunction with the Layered Architecture Pattern. It is aimed at illustrating how code of similar responsibilities can be factored into multiple logical layers which are applicable in most enterprise applications.

Take note that the main objective of the samples is to focus on layering and therefore, certain cross-cutting functionalities have been omitted for simplicity.
